* What's new in version ${project.version}?

  * Bug fix: after having removed transitions connected to unsafe arcs,
  remaining transitions have 0 input place or 0 output place.
   
  * Bug fix: count of the remaining transitions in the log.
  
  * Singleton pattern for the PNML2BPN factory.
 
* What's new in version 1.2.0?

  * <<New feature>>: upon request, BPN can be generated even in case of unsafe initial places (marking > 1) or
  unsafe arcs (inscription > 1). See {{{./usage.html}Usage page}}.
  
  * <<New feature>>: transitions connected to unsafe arcs (incoming or outgoing) can be removed upon request.
