Changelog

* What's new in version ${project.version}?

  * Debugged Bounds tool result interpretation over infinite string pattern
  
  * The execution of the Bounds tool is now timed
  
  * Report on unsafe places in the log, when the net is unsafe
  
  * The number of unsafe places to report is determined by the environment variable <<unsafe.places.nb.report>>

* What's new in version 1.4.0?

  * Refactored bounds checking option as unit safeness checking.
   
  * Introduced unit safeness checking only option, to stop the tool whatever the outcome of the unit safeness checking process.
  
  * Produced jar name is shorter (pnml2nupn instead of fr.lip6.move.pnml2nupn)

* What's new in version 1.3.2?

  * Transitions are numbered according to their order of appearance in the PNML file (Bugged. Will be fixed in the 1.4.x line).
  
  * Multiple arcs between two same nodes in the PNML are now handled (add tokens).

  * Places are numbered according to their order of appearance in the PNML file (Bugged. Will be fixed in the 1.4.x line).

* What's new in version 1.3.1?

  * Insertion of the information "total number of tokens contained in all initial places", in the pragma !multiple_initial_tokens #<nb-tokens> #<nb-places> <min>...<max>

* What's new in version 1.3.0?

  * Tool changes name: NUPN are produced, instead of BPN.
  
  * Produces the pragmas {{{http://cadp.inria.fr/man/caesar.bdd.html#sect9}!creator}}, {{{http://cadp.inria.fr/man/caesar.bdd.html#sect11}!multiple_initial_tokens}}
   and {{{http://cadp.inria.fr/man/caesar.bdd.html#sect12}!multiple_arcs}}. Consequently some properties are no longer supported (see following items).
   
  * The <<generate.unsafe>> property is no longer supported (still correctly handled at invocation time, but not processed during the translation).
  
  * The <<remove.unsafe.trans>> property is no longer supported (idem as above).
  
  * New Shell script to handle batch runs of the tool (Previous version, compatible until v1.2.2, is still provided). 


* What's new in version 1.2.2?

  * <<New feature>>: checks for the presence of unsafe arcs (inscription > 1) and reports them
  in a file <<*.unsafe.arcs>> if they are found. This behaviour is activated by an option and
  is exclusive of all the others (see {{{./usage.html}Usage page}}).

* What's new in version 1.2.1?

  * Bug fix: after having removed transitions connected to unsafe arcs,
  remaining transitions have 0 input place or 0 output place.
   
  * Bug fix: count of the remaining transitions in the log.
  
  * Singleton pattern for the PNML2BPN factory.
 
* What's new in version 1.2.0?

  * <<New feature>>: upon request, BPN can be generated even in case of unsafe initial places (marking > 1) or
  unsafe arcs (inscription > 1). See {{{./usage.html}Usage page}}.
  
  * <<New feature>>: transitions connected to unsafe arcs (incoming or outgoing) can be removed upon request.
   See {{{./usage.html}Usage page}}.
  
  * Outputs a <<*.unsafe.arcs>> file that documents removed arcs (when removal of transitions is requested).
  
  * Prints at the end of the logs tool signature and invocation parameters that were set.

* What's new in version 1.1.11?

  * Places id mapping file is now *.places instead of *.states
  
  * Improved documentation

* What's new in version 1.1.10?

  * Property to disable bounds checking (should be combined with forced BPN generation).
  
  * Handles the case of several initial places 

* What's new in version 1.1.9?

  * Force BPN generation even if the net is not 1-safe (checked by the Bounds tool).

* What's new in version 1.1.8?

  * NPE bug fix.

* What's new in version 1.1.7?

  * Bug fix on querying initial markings and non-marked place.
  
  * Bug fix on cleaning buffer in writing loop.
  
  * Transformation fails in the case where there is no marked place, 
  and where there are more then one marked place.

* What's new in version 1.1.6?

  * Relies on Cami2Pnml 2.1.8

* What's new in version 1.1.5?

  * Handles the case where there is just one place (then just one unit, which is the root one)
  
  * Error message in the case there is no place (root unit must have at least 2 sub-units,
   if it does not contain any place).


* What's new in version 1.1.4?

  * Transformation is refined: 
  
  	* places numbered from 0
  	
  	* transitions are ordred
  	
  	* root unit is the last
  	
  	* id mappings are splitted in 2 files, one for states and the other for transitions
  	
  	[]
  
  * Relies on Cami2PNML v2.1.6

* What's new in version 1.1.2?

  * Relies on Cami2PNML v2.1.5

* What's new in version 1.1.1?

  * Recursively scan directories, looking for PNML files.

* What's new in version 1.1.0?

  * Integration of the Bounds tool.

* What's new in version 1.0.0?

  * First stable release.
