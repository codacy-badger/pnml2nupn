Requirements

  * Runs on Java 1.7+
  
  * This tool was successfully run on Mac OS 10.9.2+. The integrated Bounds tool was compiled on
Mac OS 10.8. Therefore, <<there is no guaranty that it will successfully run on Linux, not even mentioning Windows>>.
There is currently no plan to release a version specifically for Windows or Linux, until we get the opportunity to do so.
